# voter-data-survey-ml

 
The objective of this project is to analyse voter behaviour in an area. A synthetic data is generated with probabilistic stochastic simulation technique to predict 
a voter’s party preference among survey-based demographic and issue related
factors.The project aims to demonstrate how supervised machine learning can be used for election-related
opinion analysis.

The project involves learning a mapping between heterogeneous input features, including categorical
demographic attributes and numerical issue-based ratings, and a discrete target label representing party preference. 
Since the target variable has more than two possible classes and class proportions are not perfectly balanced, the 
problem requires models capable of handling multiclass classification with robustness to class imbalance.
Appropriate evaluation metrics and validation strategies are therefore necessary to ensure fair and reliable
performance across all parties
